            <p>Elves are slender, fey demihumans with pointed ears. They typically weigh about 120 pounds and are between 5 and 5Â½ feet tall. Elves are seldom met in human settlements, preferring to feast and make merry in the woods. If crossed, they are dangerous enemies, as they are masters of both sword and spell. Elves are fascinated by spells and beautifully constructed magic items and love to collect both.</p>
